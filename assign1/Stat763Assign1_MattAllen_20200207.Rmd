### The earliest editions of the Tour de France had very few stages compared to today ...


```{r}
num_stages_plot <- ggplot(data = tdf_data) +
  geom_point(mapping= aes(x = year, y =  num_stages)) + 
  xlab('Year of Race') + 
  ylab('Number of Stages') + 
  ggtitle('Number of Stages by Year')
  
ggplotly(num_stages_plot)
```

### ... but they were really long by today's standards. Note the breaks for World War I and II.


```{r}
ave_stage_distance <- ggplot(data = tdf_data) +
  geom_point(mapping= aes(x = year, y =  distance / num_stages), 
             color = ifelse(tdf_data$year == 1914 | tdf_data$year == 1919 | tdf_data$year == 1939 | tdf_data$year == 1947,"red","black")) + 
  geom_text_repel(data=subset(tdf_data, year==1914),aes(x = year, y = distance / num_stages,label="Start WWI")) +

### The French have the most wins, but there has been a drought since 1985 when Bernard Hinault (the Badger) won.

```{r}
#make table of win counts by nationality
winners_nationality <- tdf_data %>%
  select(nationality) %>% #select(year, winner_name, nickname, age, nationality)
  group_by(nationality) %>%
  tally(name = "Number Wins")

#make table with nationality and last year won
last_year_by_nationality <- tdf_data %>% 
  select(nationality, year) %>%
  group_by(nationality) %>%
  filter(year == max(year))

#join the two and rename
winner_nationality_last_year <- winners_nationality %>% 
  inner_join(last_year_by_nationality) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Number Wins`)) %>% 
  rename(`Nationality` = nationality, `Last Year Won` = year )  

#create datatable
datatable(winner_nationality_last_year, options = list(pageLength = 20), rownames = FALSE)

```

### The French last win in 1985 came the year before Greg LeMond (L’Americain) slayed the Badger, and six years before the doping era, which was ended by another American.

```{r}
tdf_data_1985_2005 <- tdf_data %>%
  filter(year >= 1985 & year <= 2005)
  

ave_speed <- ggplot(data = tdf_data_1985_2005) +
  geom_point(mapping= aes(x = year, y =  distance / time_overall, shape = winner_name)) + 
  xlab('Year of Race') + 
  ylab('Average Speed (km/h)') + 
  ggtitle('Average Speed by Winner Over Entire Race') +
  labs(shape = "Winner Name")
  

ggplotly(ave_speed)
```
