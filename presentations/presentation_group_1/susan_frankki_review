Scoring Rubric
Your presentation will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    1. Presentation addressed each aspect of the prompt
    2. The presentation was clear and well-organized
    3. The presenter spoke clearly, made effective use of eye contact, and demonstrated interest and/or authority in the subject matter.
Peer Review
Each student in the class will be responsible for providing feedback on each of the other student presentations in the class. Students should use the assignment description and rubric to guide their review. These peer reviews will be due before class the Tuesday after the presentation. (Example: if student A presents on Feb 6, all other students will provide feedback by Feb 11.) These reviews should include the following:
    1. Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the presentation.
    Susan was well organized and made an attempt to directly address each one of the requirements like weaknesses of tableby, and comparing tableby to other options.

    2. Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the presentation that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.
    There could have been more interest demonstrated for the subject, but that may be a challenge when talking about a library for building tables. You could pick a topic that truly interests you.
