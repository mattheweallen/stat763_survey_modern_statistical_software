STAT 763 Homework 5
DataCamp Assignments
Complete the following assignments on DataCamp (5 points each):
•	Intermediate Data Visualization with Seaborn
•	Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)
•	Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)
Comparing IDEs
The three most common approaches to coding in Python are PyCharm, Spyder, and Google Colaborate. Why would we choose one approach over another? Which IDE is the most robust? Which is the most user-friendly? Do each of the IDEs work well on your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS), or are there common limitations/complications? How do they each handle Python scripts (.py files) and Jupyter notebooks?
Submit a brief, written document comparing the three IDEs. (5 points)
Data Visualization in a Jupyter Notebook
Create a scatterplot, a bar chart, and a density plot of the classic Iris data (iris.csv) using Seaborn. Data should be grouped (or colored) if appropriate (e.g., by species). Include a brief description of the plot or insights gained from the plot. Your Jupyter Notebook should also have a header (section definition) for each of the three plots.
Submit your Jupyter Notebook (either the file, or a link to the online repository). (10 points)

Tell Girija about this.

Tell Environments that you are building.

Create Windows Docker Image.
