An Introduction to SAS Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

This is an interesting presentation, because SAS is one of the major Statistics packages, but I have not had the opportunity to use or learn about it.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

There are some minor issues like not capitalizing proper nouns like Excel.
