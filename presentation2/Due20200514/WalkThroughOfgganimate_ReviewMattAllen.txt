A Walk Through of gganimate Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

The live animations of the plots are cool.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

There are some code chunks that are commented out, and probably should not be shown.
