Improving Classification with Neural Networks Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

This is not something I understand that well, but it seems like the presentation is very detailed on how to use the Keras package.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

Perhaps because of my lack of understanding of the topic, I wish there was more explanation of what the output means.
