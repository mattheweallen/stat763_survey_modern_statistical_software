Sentiment Analysis in R Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

I do not have much experience performing sentiment analysis, so seeing the features of TidyText is a good start on understanding what it can tell us.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

It is not clear to me what Afinn, Bing and Nrc are. Some more detail on those would be nice.
