Data Explorer Package Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

I liked that your presentation was interactive. You can click on the buttons and change the output. I also like that the presentation could be reproduced.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

There are some spelling and grammatical issues, but overall the presentation was a nice walk through on how to use the Data Explorer package and why you would want to use it.
