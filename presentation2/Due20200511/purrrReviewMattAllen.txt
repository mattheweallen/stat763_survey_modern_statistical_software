purrr Review by Matt Allen 

1.	Describe one (or more) positive aspects of the walkthrough.

The presentation is well organized and provides good motivation for using the package.

2.	Provide constructive criticism of one (or more) aspects of the walkthrough that you feel could be improved. As this is constructive, provide some justification and/or advice on ways to improve.

There is a mention of S3 objects in the splice function detail. It is unclear to me what an S3 object is. That is minor, but could be clarified.
