Reticulate Review 
by Matt Allen

Being able to call Python from R is interesting. 

I think Pandas was created to make an R like data frames possible in Python. I am not sure if using Pandas in R is useful in practice especially with Tidyverse. I do like the suggestion of using scikit learn.

Python calling programs written in other languages would also be interesting. I have seen this as something that people want to be able to do. For example, if something was writting in C or C# can you call it from Python.
