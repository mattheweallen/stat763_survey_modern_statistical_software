<!-- Your task is to make a Shiny app that allows for exploration of Coronavirus data. -->

<!-- The data source is [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/). You can access the data directly on their [Github page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). -->

<!-- Visiting the CSSE webpage, you'll see an example of a web app (maybe not written in Shiny) that allows for lots of user interactivity (if it works in your browser, at least). Poke around their app a bit and find interesting patterns or interesting functionality. -->

<!-- Your app should be computationally efficient, effective at conveying information, and visually appealing. Your users should have as much control as is reasonable -- too much control might obscure your story.  -->

<!-- Post your shiny app on shinyapps.io. Submit your (compressed) app directory and a link to your web app on Canvas by the due date. -->
